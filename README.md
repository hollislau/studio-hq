# StudioHQ

A functional prototype of a web application was reproduced from a design comprehensive. Currently, the app has no data persistence beyond the session; only the client-side functionality has been built.

You may clone this repo and install the app by running `npm install`. Run it locally with `npm start` and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> on your browser to view it. Tests have not yet been written for this app.
